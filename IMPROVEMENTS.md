```typescript
(35 × aperture + 30 × pixelPitch) ÷ (focalLength × cropFactor)
```
- More accurate for modern high-resolution cameras
- Accounts for aperture and pixel density
- Provides star spot size calculations

### 3. Hyperfocal Distance (New!)
```typescript
(focalLength² ÷ (aperture × circleOfConfusion)) + focalLength
```
- Essential for landscape astrophotography
- Adjusts for crop factor automatically
- Shows both metric and imperial units

### 4. Stacking Calculator (New!)
- Calculates optimal exposure count for target session time
- Shows SNR improvement factor
- Helps plan multi-hour imaging sessions

## 🎛️ Enhanced Features

### Smart Calculations
- **Dynamic rule selection** - Choose between 500, 400, or NPF rule
- **Real-time updates** - Instant recalculation on parameter changes
- **Context-aware recommendations** - Suggestions based on equipment
