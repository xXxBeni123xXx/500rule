## üìã Overview
This PR represents a complete architectural overhaul of the AstroCalc Pro application, transforming it from a monolithic, hard-to-maintain codebase into a modern, well-structured React application that follows industry best practices.

## üîÑ What Changed & Why

### **1. Code Architecture Transformation**
**Before**: Single `App.tsx` file with 798 lines containing mixed concerns (UI, state, business logic, API calls)
**After**: Modular component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

**Why**: The original monolithic structure violated the single responsibility principle, making the code difficult to maintain, debug, and extend. The new architecture follows React best practices and makes the codebase professional-grade.

### **2. State Management Revolution**
**Before**: 15+ scattered `useState` hooks throughout the component
**After**: Centralized state management using React Context + useReducer pattern

**Why**: Multiple useState hooks led to complex state synchronization, unpredictable re-renders, and difficult debugging. The new pattern provides predictable state updates, better performance, and centralized state logic.

### **3. Performance Optimization**
**Before**: Search filtering and calculations executed on every render
**After**: Memoized calculations and search with `useMemo` hooks

**Why**: The original implementation caused unnecessary re-renders and poor performance, especially during search operations. Memoization ensures calculations only run when dependencies change.

### **4. Component Decomposition**
**Before**: All UI logic crammed into one massive component
**After**: 10+ focused, single-responsibility components

**Why**: The monolithic component was impossible to test, debug, or reuse. Individual components are easier to maintain, test, and can be developed by different team members simultaneously.

### **5. Business Logic Extraction**
**Before**: Business logic mixed with UI components
**After**: Custom hooks for data fetching, search, and calculations

**Why**: Mixing business logic with UI makes both harder to test and maintain. Custom hooks provide reusable business logic that can be tested independently.

## üèóÔ∏è New Architecture Details

### **State Management (`src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`)**
- **Reducer Pattern**: Implemented a comprehensive reducer with 18 action types
- **Action Creators**: Type-safe action dispatching with proper payload handling
- **State Synchronization**: Automatic state cleanup when dependencies change (e.g., resetting lens when camera changes)

### **Custom Hooks**
- **`useDataFetching`**: Centralized API calls with proper error handling and loading states
- **`useSearch`**: Advanced search algorithms with memoization for performance
- **`useCalculations`**: Cached astrophotography calculations with optimized dependencies

### **Component Structure**
- **`Header`**: Animated application header with branding
- **`TabNavigation`**: Clean tab switching with state management
- **`GuidedMode`**: Camera/lens selection interface
- **`ManualMode`**: Manual parameter input and results
- **`ResultsPanel`**: Calculation display with tooltips and risk assessment
- **`BackgroundStars`**: Animated background effects
- **`ErrorDisplay`**: Centralized error handling
- **`CameraPicker`**: Enhanced camera selection with search
- **`LensPicker`**: Smart lens filtering and focal length controls

- **Partial Matching**: Intelligent substring and word-based search
- **Aperture Search**: Support for "f2.8" and "2.8" style queries
- **Focal Length Matching**: "12mm" matches "12-24mm" zoom lenses

### **Calculation Caching**
- **Memoized Results**: Exposure calculations only recompute when inputs change
- **Dependency Optimization**: Carefully crafted dependency arrays for maximum efficiency
- **Trail Risk Assessment**: Cached risk calculations with proper memoization

### **Render Optimization**
- **Conditional Rendering**: Components only render when their tab is active
- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth enter/exit animations with proper lifecycle management
- **Reduced Re-renders**: State updates only trigger necessary component updates
